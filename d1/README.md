Notes:

Yay, ambiguity in part 2! The goal is:

```
How many blocks away is the first location you visit twice?
```

Now is 'first' about
# the first time you do a second visit, or
# the first location along the path that has more than one visit?

For example:
```
     11  10
  1 2/12 3/9 4
     13   8  5
          7  6
```

For interpretation 1 the answer would be 3, for interpretation 2 it would be 3.
Hmmm.

For my input the answer turns out to be the same.
